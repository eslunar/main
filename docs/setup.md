PlayScript - Setup
---
Playscript is originally available at `https://playscript.co/ps.js` but you can also access it from **UNPKG**, **JSDELIVR**, **CDNJS** according to their respective formats.


###### create an `index.html` file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <script src="//playscript.co/ps.js">
    {
      "name":"My awesome app",
      "main":"./entry.js"
    }
  </script>
</html>
```
The structure depends on you, but a manifest in the script tag is required.

###### create an `entry.js` file:
```javascript
console.log("hello from MAIN thread!")
```

And thats about it, run via localhost in your browser and see results.
